## Welcome to Fintech Learners Pages For Non Tech

This is my first time creating this website via Github. 

I am a non tech learner.

I can feel the pain to pick up new skills for any Fintech related topics which can be overwhelming. 

Sometimes I feel lost, but is ok to feel lost and self doubt ourselves.

I realise it is good to feel lost which means we take this learning seriously.

But looking back no matter what, today I am better than before, I had completed four months of Fintech program, looking back, I realise I am better than before I started this program.

If you are like me, not very tech savvy, afraid of learning new tech skills.

Don't worry, I was in that situation before, with more time to practice at our own pace, definitely we are better than before.

And here I am, I have used Github to create this website without any coding needed.

Isn't it amazing!!!


If I can do it, so can you!!


So please never give up learning new tech.


Just treat it as a new hobby and learn at your own pace and tap on your creativity to create wonderful projects and share in Github and we shall learn and grow together.

Although there are various online resources available for free, I realise that for non tech learners like us is overwhelming and we do feel lost. 

Therefore I created this website to document various online resources (articles or videos that are suitable for non-tech learners to learn at their own pace).

If you have any interesting videos that are suitable for non tech learners do let me know and help me to build this website more user friendly for non tech learners.


“If a picture is worth a thousand words, then a video is worth a million.”


This website I hope I can share more videos that are more suitable for non tech learners so that we (non tech learners) can watch the videos and do the project at the same time.

The main reason to create this website is to document the online resources be it videos etc in an organised manner.

Definitely there will be lots of changes for this website, along the way I will pick up new tech skills to make this website more user friendly for non tech users.

This website will showcase videos that I find useful and suitable for non tech to pick up the skills.

If I can do it, I believe the rest of the non tech can do it too, just give yourself more time to practice.

I hope I can build a Fintech non tech learners community and more non tech learners able to create wonderful projects and share master pieces in Github.

Thanks for dropping by to visit this website.
