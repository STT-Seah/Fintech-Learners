## Welcome to Fintech Learners Pages For Non Tech

This is my first time creating this website via Github. 

I am a non tech learner. 

I can feel the pain to pick up new skills for any Fintech related topics which can be overwhelming. 

If you are like me, not very tech savvy, afraid of learning new tech skills.

“If a picture is worth a thousand words, then a video is worth a million.”

This website I hope I can share more videos that are more suitable for non tech learners so that we (non tech learners) can watch the videos and do the project at the same time.

The main reason to create this website is to document the online resources in an organised manner.

This website will showcase videos that I find useful and suitable for non tech to pick up the skills.

If I can do it, I believe the rest of the non tech can do it too, just give yourself more time to practice.

I hope I can build a Fintech non tech learners community and more non tech learners able to create wonderful projects and share their master pieces in Github.

Thanks for dropping by to visit this website.
